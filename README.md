<!--

__Professional Outline__

Technical professional with experience in water, power, reaction engineering, industrial control and energy efficiency spaces. 

Qualified in chemical engineering, data engineering, project management and construction management. 

Delivered significant technological benefits from analytical capabilities through opex / environmental impact reduction and beyond.


### [Psychology Experiment](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/Experiment)

*Python | PsychoPy*

The files here allow one to run a Stroop Task on multiple participants, before running a basic analysis on the results. This was one of the first Python projects I worked on with minimal tutorials or assistance. It was here that I learned how to program, and began to develop some proficiency with Python. 

### [DataQuest Data Engineering](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/DataQuestDE)

*Python | SQL | Pandas*

This contains a series of projects I have completed as part of the Data Engineering track via DataQuest (in progress).

## [Mock Media App](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/MediaApp)

*Python | Object Orientated Programming | Event Driven Programming | Tkinter*

This is a basic Python application developed using Tkinter. It's not a real media app, as the project was more intended to as practice. Specifically this helped me gain an appreciation of event driven and object orientated programming. 

## [File Search](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/FileSearch/)

*Python | Event Driven Programming | Tkinter*

This is a python application developed using Tkinter. This apps allows one to search all text files within a specified directory for a specified string. This saves results to a listbox, as well as a CSV. This is very basic, but may be built upon in the future.

## [ASCII Art](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/ASCII)

*Python | PIL*

This is a python script which can convert a normal image into ASCII-Art. It was completed as a guided project to help develop my skills in Python.
